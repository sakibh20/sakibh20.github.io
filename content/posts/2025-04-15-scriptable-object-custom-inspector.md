# Unity Custom Inspector for Hierarchical ScriptableObjects

This project showcases a **custom Unity Inspector** built to simplify editing complex **ScriptableObject hierarchies**. When dealing with deep inheritance trees and diverse data types, Unity’s default inspector becomes cluttered — showing fields that aren’t always relevant.

This tool addresses that by displaying **only the necessary fields** for the actual subclass type, streamlining the editing experience.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🎯 **Context-aware field rendering**: Displays only the relevant fields for each asset’s specific subclass.
- 🧱 **Supports deep inheritance trees**: Smoothly handles base and nested subclass fields.
- 🗂️ **Cleaner editor interface**: Eliminates noise in the inspector for better focus and usability.
- 🧩 **Designed for modular architectures**: Perfect for ScriptableObject-driven systems.

## 📂 Project Context

This tool was part of a larger Unity project aimed at building scalable systems using ScriptableObjects, data-driven design, and custom tooling. It played a key role in improving designer experience and maintaining clean data structures.
