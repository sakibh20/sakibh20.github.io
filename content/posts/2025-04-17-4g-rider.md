### Banglalink 4G Rider  
>Alienide Interactive Ltd.

- **Game Engine**: Unity  
- **Platform**: Windows  
- **Client**: Banglalink  
- **Keywords**: `Serial Communication`, `Hardware`, `Local Registration`, `Data Storage`, `Arduino`

**Banglalink 4G Rider** is an activation-based **cycle race game** designed for promoting **Banglalink 4G**. The game integrates a **physical gym cycle** with the gameplay, where the playerâ€™s cycling speed directly influences the in-game character's movement. The faster the user pedals, the faster their in-game character cycles through the race path.

Key Features:
- **Gym Cycle Integration**: Utilizes a physical gym cycle via `serial communication` to control the in-game character's speed based on the user's pedaling speed  
- **Multiplayer or Timed Mode**: Players can race against each other or challenge a time counter to see who can finish the course fastest  
- **Local Registration**: Collects player information (Name and Phone Number) through a simple local registration system  
- **Data Storage**: Saves player data in an `.xl` file on the local machine for easy record-keeping and analysis  
- **Activation Purpose**: Designed for event activations and promotions, engaging users physically and digitally  

This project combines **hardware integration** with **gaming** for an immersive experience that also promotes **Banglalink's 4G service**.
